      My work as a PERFORMER: <br><br>
      Five years ago I started working for cruise companies. My first contract was with NCL as part of the production cast, my second contract was with the company "Celebrity Cruises" as Guest Entertainer (I have been performer of the show "Mirage" of the company "Les Farfadais"). My last contract was with Hapag-Lloyd Cruises working for the french company "Imagine Shows". Throughout these years I have worked for several national and international companies in theatres and street shows. Some of these street shows are Voalá Station, Muaré Experience and I have also worked for companies such as La Fura Dels Baus and Carros de Foc.  Spain, Argentina, France, England, Portugal, Romania, Germany, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia are some of the countries where I have worked in the street. In addition, together with the company Subcielo I have worked in several theaters in Spain in their show "The Flight of Da Vinci". The Romea Theater of Murcia, Main Theater of Alicante, Grand Theater of Elche, Circus Theater of Albacete, Quijano Theater of Ciudad Real and the Auditorium Theater of Cuenca are some of the rooms where we have presented with this company.

      My work as a COACH: <br><br> 
      Thanks to the strong vocation I have for teaching, for more than 10 years I have been working in different acrobatics schools in Argentina and Spain as an acrobatics teacher specializing in aerial fabrics.
      <br><br><br>
      My work as a CULTURAL MANAGER:<br><br>
      In 2017 I was part of the group that promoted the creation of the professionaliation center of performing arts called "Espacio Fractal" (Alicante, Spain). I currently work as an advisor to this center. Espacio Fractal is a center that offers spaces for the formation, creation and exhibition of performing arts.</p>
